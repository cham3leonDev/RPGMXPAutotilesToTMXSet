# RPGMXPAutotilesToTMXSet
This .js plugin allows you to convert your RPMGXP autotiles into a tileset for Tiled. I designed this plugin for converting Pokémon Essentials autotiles from RPGMXP.
The idea and plugin is based on eishiya's "Expand RPG Maker Autotile Tileset" https://github.com/eishiya/tiled-expand-autotile?tab=readme-ov-file , which is based on devium's https://github.com/devium/tiled-autotile
# How To Use
Right now the plugin only supports the ground autotile (96x128, 3:4) as seen in the example .png, so only use this format.

Click on the green "Code" and download the ZIP. Unzip it and put the .js file into your user/AppData/Local/Tiled/extensions folder. Restart Tiled and go to File>New RMXP Autotile Tileset. Select the .png and make sure the tile width and height are both 32. Choose a folder where you would like to store the .tmx.

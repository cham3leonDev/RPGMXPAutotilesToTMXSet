# RPGMXPAutotilesToTMXSet
This .js plugin allows you to convert your RPMGXP autotiles into a tileset for Tiled. I designed this plugin for converting Pokémon Essentials autotiles from RPGMXP.
The idea and plugin is based on eishiya's "Expand RPG Maker Autotile Tileset" https://github.com/eishiya/tiled-expand-autotile?tab=readme-ov-file
# How To Use
Right now the plugin only supports the ground autotile (96x128, 3:4) as seen in the example .png, so only use this format.

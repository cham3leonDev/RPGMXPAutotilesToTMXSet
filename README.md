# RPGMXPAutotilesToTMXSet
This .js plugin allows you to convert your RPMGXP autotiles into a tileset for Tiled. I designed this plugin for converting Pokémon Essentials autotiles from RPGMXP.
The idea and plugin is based on eishiya's "Expand RPG Maker Autotile Tileset" https://github.com/eishiya/tiled-expand-autotile?tab=readme-ov-file
